If you're looking to get started learning Azure I always suggest thinking about doing the Azure exams. Take a look at AZ-900 which is the fundamentals exam, this will focus you on learning and give you a purpose.

Hands on learning for me is the best way that I learn, you may well be different. If not, I would suggest Microsoft Learn as a great place to get started https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/.
